          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct! The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This is a fundamental constant of nature."

          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, not 150,000,000 meters per second."
        },
        {
          "text": "343 meters per second",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. 343 meters per second is the speed of sound in air at room temperature, not the speed of light."
        },
        {
          "text": "3,000,000 meters per second",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, which is about 100 times faster than 3,000,000 meters per second."

        {
          "text": "Red",
          "isCorrect": false,

          "text": "Yellow",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "explanation": "Correct! Yellow is NOT a primary color in light. Yellow is a primary color in pigment (like paint), but in light, yellow is created by mixing red and green light. This is why TVs and computer screens can create yellow using just red, green, and blue pixels."

      ],
      "funFact": "The colors we see on screens use additive color mixing (RGB), while the colors in paint use subtractive color mixing (CMYK). That's why printers use cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks!"

        {
          "text": "Diffraction of light",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. While diffraction is an important light phenomenon, rainbows are primarily formed by refraction and reflection of light in water droplets."
        },
        {
          "text": "Reflection of light only",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. Rainbows involve both reflection and refraction of light, not just reflection alone."

          "text": "Refraction, reflection, and dispersion of light",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "image": "rainbow-formation.jpg",
          "explanation": "Correct! Rainbows form when sunlight enters water droplets in the air, gets refracted (bent), then reflected off the back of the droplet, and finally refracted again as it exits. This process causes different wavelengths (colors) of light to separate or disperse, creating the familiar rainbow pattern."
        },
        {
          "text": "Polarization of light",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "explanation": "Incorrect. Polarization refers to the restriction of light wave vibrations to a single plane, which is not the primary cause of rainbow formation."
        }
      ],
      "funFact": "A double rainbow occurs when light is reflected twice inside water droplets. That's why the colors in the secondary rainbow appear in reverse order!"
