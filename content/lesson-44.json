                    "explanation": "According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), heavier objects require more force to achieve the same acceleration. Since both toys need to cover the same distance in the same time, they must have equal acceleration, requiring different forces."

                    "explanation": "According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), force is directly proportional to mass when acceleration is constant. Since the truck is 3 times heavier than the car and both need to achieve the same acceleration to cover equal distance in equal time, the truck requires 3 times more force."

                    "explanation": "This is incorrect because according to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), heavier objects need more force, not less, to achieve the same acceleration. Since the truck has 3 times more mass, it needs more force, not less."

            "funFact": "In space where there is virtually no friction, astronauts still need to use more force to push heavier objects to achieve the same acceleration. This is a direct application of Newton's Second Law (F=ma). This is why moving large satellites or equipment in space requires carefully calculated propulsion systems!"
