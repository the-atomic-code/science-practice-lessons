                    "explanation": "Since Ball A is moving twice as fast, it has four times the kinetic energy (KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2) to transfer during the collision. Because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity, doubling the speed quadruples the energy, causing the pin to move approximately four times as far."
