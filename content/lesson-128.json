                    "explanation": "The structural design and flexibility of a building are crucial for earthquake resistance. Buildings need to be designed to absorb and dissipate seismic energy, allowing them to sway without collapsing. This includes proper foundation design, appropriate materials, and structural elements that can withstand lateral forces."

                    "explanation": "Structural flexibility allows buildings to absorb and dissipate earthquake energy rather than resist it rigidly. Base isolation systems effectively separate the structure from ground motion, which is why modern seismic engineering considers these among the most important factors in earthquake-resistant design."
