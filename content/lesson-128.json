                    "explanation": "The structural design and flexibility of a building are crucial for earthquake resistance. Buildings need to be designed to absorb and dissipate seismic energy, allowing them to sway without collapsing. This includes proper foundation design, appropriate materials, and structural elements that can withstand lateral forces."
